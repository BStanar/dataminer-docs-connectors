## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

  - **IP address/host**: [The polling IP or URL of the destination.]
  - **IP port**: [The IP port of the destination. (default: *443*)]
  - **Device address**: [The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.]

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The device web interface separates the parameters in to two groups: Status and Config. In the connector, those parameters are presented in a way where each module has a separate page for the status and config parameters. When the user wants to control/configure the parameters, go to the corresponding Config page of the module. All the information about the **Unit** module is presented in the **General**, **Device**, **Firmware** and **Power Supply** pages.
