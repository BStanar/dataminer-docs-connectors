## About

An NCC-2222 chassis, as part of the Narrowcast Controller system, combines broadcast amplification with advanced controller functionality. It manages all connected NarrowCast inserters (NCI-521/WB or NCI-521-12, up to 22 units) while supporting dual broadcast input (A/B) for redundancy. With this connector, you will be able to monitor each connected unit via a separate child element in DataMiner.
