# Hessischer Rundfunk ABR Audio Monitoring Service

The **ABR Audio Monitoring Service** is a customer specific protocol created and designed as an enhanced service protocol. On creation of a service, the protocol can be used to create an enhanced element to monitor and aggregate the overall audio alarm status.

Individual alarm statusses are available as:
- Encoding Bitrate Status

### Key Features
