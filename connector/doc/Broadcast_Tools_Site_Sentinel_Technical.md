## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection - Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: [The polling IP or URL of the destination.]
- **IP port**: [The IP port of the destination.]
- **Bus address**: [The bus address of the device.]

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: [The community string used when reading values from the device. (default: *public*)]
- **Set community string**: [The community string used when setting values on the device. (default: *private*)]

### Initialization

No additional configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

An SNMP connection is used to retrieve all relevant data needed to monitor the Site Sentinel.

The **Meter** table on the **Meters** page contains custom columns (**Calibration Formula**, **Calibration Multiplier**, and **Expected Calculated Value**) that can be used to alter the incoming **Value** from the device. If no alteration is needed, leave the columns with their default values.
