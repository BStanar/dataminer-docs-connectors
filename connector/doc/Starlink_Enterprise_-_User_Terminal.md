# Starlink Enterprise - User Terminal

The Starlink Enterprise - User Terminal connector is exported by the parent connector [Starlink Enterprise](xref:Connector_help_Starlink_Enterprise). For each known User Terminal, a separate child element using this connector will automatically be created. These child elements contain only User Terminal-related data.

## Configuration

### Initialization

The element using this connector can only be created by the parent element using the [Starlink Enterprise](xref:Connector_help_Starlink_Enterprise) connector. No additional configuration is necessary.

## How to Use

This connector is automatically generated by the Starlink Enterprise, range 1.0.0.x. For each entry in the User Terminal DVEs table, a separate element will be created. The name of these child elements will be the ID of the user terminal.

To create an element, simply Enable the User Terminals table DVE Creation togglebutton of a specific terminal on the parent element.

This connector cannot be used to create a standalone element. You need to create a parent element using the Starlink Enterprise connector to be able to see the exported child elements.

### General Page

All telemetry data can be found on the General Page.

### Alerts Page

Each row in the **Alerts** table represents an alert that comes from a user terminal (not from a router). Alerts will persist for as long as they are active.

The **User Terminal Device ID** column in this table is hidden by default. You can show it by right-clicking the table column header, selecting **Columns**, and then selecting this column.
