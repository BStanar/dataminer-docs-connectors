## Installation and configuration

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device. \[e.g. 10.10.15.1\]

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device. \[default: *161*\]
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. \[default: public\]
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. \[default: private\]

## Usage

### Modules

This page contains the **Modules Info** Table. This table contains all the cards and offers the ability to display these cards or make them invisible. The page button **Modules \[DEL\]** contains a table with the cards that have been removed from the chassis. In case a card broke and has to be removed from the chassis then this card is moved to this table. When a new card of the same type is plugged in then this will move back. This ensures that trending/alarming history is not deleted. If you do not want to keep this history you can delete this card in the **Modules Info \[DEL\]** table.

From 1.0.1.x onwards, the **Modules \[DEL\]** table is removed. and this logic is transferred into the **Modules Info** table. When modules are no longer existing, these rows will be marked as deleted. And the Delete button will be enabled. The toggle button to auto delete these DVEs remains the same.

### General

This page contains the general parameters: e.g. **Customer Name**, **Customer Location**, etc.

### Controller

This page contains the parameters for the controller. This page is divided in the **status** parameters, the **alarm** parameters, the **configuration** parameters and the **network configuration** parameters. e.g. **Controller Status PSU 1 Voltage**, **Controller Config Date Time**, **Controller Config Network Ip Address**, ...

### Traps

This page contains all the traps.

### Web Interface

Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.

## Supported cards

### RFSW04A

The RFSW04A card is an advanced L-band switch (RFSW-04) that can be used with both Elber MS2 and third-part Modulator
