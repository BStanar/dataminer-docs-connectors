# CISCO Catalyst SD-WAN

## About

This is a DataMiner connector for the **CISCO Catalyst SD-WAN** (Software-Defined WAN), a software-based Wide Area Network management solution developed by CISCO with integrated capabilities for multicloud, security, predictive operations, and enhanced network visibility on a SASE-enabled architecture.
This driver connects to the solution by an HTTP connection and displays various information, including connected Devices, their respective Sites and Tunnels, Network Health, Certificates data and Alarms.

### Key Features

- **Monitor your Wide Area Network**: Monitor connected devices, tunnels and sites including their current health.

- **Track your Certificates and Alarms**: Keep track of your system's Certificates and reported Alarms, including their critical dates and sources.

- **Easy Authentication**: Authenticate using a Username and a Password, which will enable you to access and monitor your network solution.

## Use Cases [WIP]

### Remote Monitoring of Device Alarms

**Challenge:** Monitor CISCO devices from a single source.

**Solution:** With this connector, you can set and manage alarm thresholds for the CISCO devices. This allows proactive monitoring and minimizes the risk of unforeseen system failures.

**Benefit:** Potential issues can be quickly addressed in real time, improving the reliability and performance of network operations.
