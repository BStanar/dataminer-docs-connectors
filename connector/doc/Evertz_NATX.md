# Connector marketing documentation template

## About

This connector enables Skyline DataMiner to interface with the Evertz NATX, a high-performance IP network address translation router used in broadcast and media environments. The driver provides real-time monitoring, control, and diagnostics of NATX devices, ensuring seamless IP address translation and routing within complex media networks.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks the operational status and performance metrics of the NATX device.

- **IP Translation Table Access**: Provides visibility into active NAT sessions and translation mappings.

- **Alarm Management**: Detects and reports faults or threshold breaches, enabling proactive maintenance.

- **Configuration Control**: Allows remote configuration of NAT rules and routing parameters directly from DataMiner.

- **Scalability Support**: Supports monitoring of multiple NATX units across distributed environments.

## Use Cases

### Use Cases 1

**Challenge**: Managing IP address translation in a dynamic broadcast environment with multiple live streams.

**Solution**: The driver provides real-time visibility into NAT mappings and session states.

**Benefit**: Ensures uninterrupted stream routing and simplifies troubleshooting of IP conflicts.

### Use Cases 2

**Challenge**: Detecting and responding to NAT device failures or performance degradation.

**Solution**: Integrated alarm management and performance metrics alert operators to issues.

**Benefit**: Reduces downtime and improves network reliability through proactive maintenance.

### Use Cases 3

**Challenge**: Configuring and updating NAT rules across multiple devices manually.

**Solution**: Centralized control via DataMiner allows remote configuration of NATX units.

**Benefit**: Saves time, reduces human error, and ensures consistent network policies.
