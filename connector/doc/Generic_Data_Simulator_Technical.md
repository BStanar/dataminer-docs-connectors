## About

Generic Data Simulator is a virtual connector, where users can customize and mimic any kind of API or device interface by adding parameter simulations with various trending type possibilities.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use (1.0.0.X)

CPU load and NIC bitrate simulation are customizable through **General** and **Interfaces** pages, respectively.

## How to use (2.0.0.X)

Adding simulated parameters is done through the context menu in the Simulations table. User can add static values and trended numeric values with various behaviors. It is also possible to edit and delete simulators from the same context menu.

Measurement unit and groups can be assigned to each simulator, which serve as conceptual classification of simulators, and can be added through context menu's in the tables found on the **Configuration** page.
