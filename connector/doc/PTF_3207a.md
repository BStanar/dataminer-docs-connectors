## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

When you have created a new element, make sure all necessary SNMP settings and Telnet credentials are properly configured.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product. It provides a comprehensive set of monitoring and configuration options, similar to the command line interface.

## How to Use

To visualize parameters polled from Telnet, configure the Telnet settings:

- **Credentials**: Enter the required Telnet credentials. This is crucial for Telnet functionality.
- **Module Polling**: Enable polling for each module if the device includes that module.
- **Telnet Settings**: Adjust polling state, timer, and timeout according to your preferences.

Configure these settings to ensure efficient operation and accurate monitoring of the PTF 3207A device.

## Notes

Proper SNMP and Telnet configuration is crucial for reliable operation. The flexibility of enabling/disabling modules and adjusting polling settings allows for tailored monitoring and management of the device.
