This connector uses an HTTP connection and an SNMP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: The device API IP Port *(default 443)*
- **BusAddress:** The Computer System ID *(default: 1)*

#### SNMP Connection

Note: This connection is only available on 1.1.1.x onwards.

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: The device IP Port *(default 161)*

## Usage
