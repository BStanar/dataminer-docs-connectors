## About

The Telefonia por Cable S.A. de C.V. Ticketing BE connector facilitates the sending and updating of tickets processed by the Telefonia por Cable S.A. de C.V. Ticketing WM connector to the Cherwell and SFyC Platforms via their APIs.

## Key Features

* **Ticket Sending and Updating**: Sends and updates tickets processed by the Telefonia por Cable S.A. de C.V. Ticketing WM connector.

* **Cherwell and SFyC Platform Integration**: Communicates with Cherwell and SFyC Platforms via their APIs.

* **Ticket Processing Control**: Enables or disables ticket processing.

* **Retry Mechanism**: Configures the number of retries for failed ticket operations.

* **Batch Sending**: Sends tickets in batches to optimize API requests.

## Use Cases

### Synchronizing Tickets with External Platforms

**Challenge**: Telefonia por Cable S.A. de C.V. needs to ensure that tickets processed in their internal system are accurately reflected in external platforms like Cherwell and SFyC.

**Solution**: The Telefonia por Cable S.A. de C.V. Ticketing BE connector automatically sends and updates ticket information to these external platforms via their APIs.

**Benefit**: Maintains data consistency across systems, avoids manual data entry, and ensures that external platforms have the most up-to-date ticket information.

### Handling Ticket Processing Errors

**Challenge**: Network issues or API downtime can cause failures when sending or updating tickets, potentially leading to data loss or inconsistencies.

**Solution**: The connector includes a configurable retry mechanism that attempts to resend failed ticket operations. Tickets that exceed the maximum number of retries are marked as errors for later review.

**Benefit**: Improves the reliability of ticket processing, minimizes data loss, and provides a mechanism for handling and recovering from errors.

### Optimizing Ticket Transmission

**Challenge**: Sending a large number of tickets individually to external platforms can be inefficient and may overload the API.

**Solution**: The connector can batch multiple tickets into a single API request.

**Benefit**: Optimizes the transmission of tickets, reduces the number of API calls, and improves overall performance.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites
