# Skyline Station Monitor

The **Skyline Station Montior** is a real-time monitoring and automation driver for collecting system data, tracking parameters, and executing custom actions with precision.

## Key Features
- Monitors standard system parameters at regular intervals.
- Retrieves custom values from specified elements and parameters.
- Ability to define custom polling frequency and view results and alarm states.
- Provides historical polling timestamps for analysis.

## Use Cases

### Remote Industrial Monitoring

**Challenge**: Industrial sites require continuous monitoring of environmental parameters and equipment status across multiple locations.

**Solution**: The X-600M allows remote access to sensor data and system status via its web interface, eliminating the need for on-site personnel.

**Benefit**: Reduces operational costs, improves response time to system failures, and ensures compliance with industry regulations.

### Automated Equipment Control

**Challenge**: Industrial facilities need an automated way to control pumps, valves, and other machinery based on real-time sensor data.

**Solution**: Using built-in logic and scripting, the X-600M automates equipment operations based on predefined conditions.

**Benefit**: Enhances efficiency, reduces manual intervention, and minimizes the risk of human error.
